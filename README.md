# Course Overview

This repository contains my completed coursework, milestones, and final projects for CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

The course emphasized the design, implementation, and evaluation of core data structures and algorithms in C++, with a focus on runtime analysis, scalability, and problem-solving techniques that align with real-world software engineering practices.

This work demonstrates my ability to design efficient algorithms, analyze performance trade-offs, and develop readable, maintainable, and adaptable code solutions.

# Portfolio Artifacts

The following artifacts from this course have been added to my GitHub portfolio to showcase my technical skills and growth:

# *Project One; Runtime and Memory Analysis* #

Comprehensive evaluation of runtime complexities and space trade-offs for vector, hash table, and binary search tree implementations.

Includes pseudocode, runtime comparison tables, and Big-O analysis.

# *Project Two; Advising Assistance Program (C++)*

Fully functional C++ program that loads course data from a CSV file, stores it in a binary search tree, and prints an alphanumeric course list.

Implements menu options for loading data, printing sorted courses, searching for course details, and exiting the program.

Highlights algorithmic design, structured logic, and data-driven decision making.

# *Supporting Files:*

ABCU_Advising_Program_Input.csv (sample dataset)

Project milestones (Modules 3–7) reflecting design iteration and testing progress

# What problem were you solving?

The goal of both projects was to build an advising tool for ABCU that could load course data from a file, organize it efficiently, and allow users to view courses in alphanumeric order or look up a specific course’s details and prerequisites. This problem required designing, comparing, and implementing data structures capable of handling both sorting and searching efficiently.

# How did you approach the problem?

I began by designing pseudocode for three data structures: vector, hash table, and binary search tree, to analyze their performance and trade-offs. I focused on how data structures influence algorithm efficiency and system scalability. The binary search tree emerged as the optimal structure for this problem because of its ordered traversal and balanced runtime for search and insert operations.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks?

During development, I encountered challenges such as file parsing errors and data not loading correctly into the structure. I resolved these by validating inputs, debugging file-handling logic, and using test cases to ensure reliable parsing. I also learned to apply incremental testing, checking each function separately before combining them into the main program.

# How has your work expanded your approach to software design?

Working through these projects reshaped how I view software design. I learned that designing efficient programs starts long before coding, through pseudocode planning, clear data organization, and runtime prediction. Understanding algorithmic efficiency now influences every coding decision I make, from choosing data structures to managing loops and recursion.

# How has this evolved the way you write code?

This experience taught me the importance of clarity and adaptability in writing maintainable code. I now focus on meaningful variable names, modular design, and inline comments to ensure others can read and expand my work easily. I also think critically about performance and scalability, which helps me write cleaner, more optimized programs.

# Portfolio Note

This artifact highlights my growth as a computer science student and software engineer. It demonstrates my ability to:

* Evaluate data structures based on performance and scalability.

* Design modular, efficient C++ programs grounded in strong algorithmic reasoning.

* Translate theoretical concepts into functional, real-world solutions.

Together, these projects reflect not only my technical proficiency but also my problem-solving mindset, attention to efficiency, and commitment to producing clean, maintainable code.
