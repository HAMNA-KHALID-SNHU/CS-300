# CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework and project work for **CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms** at **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**.  
It demonstrates my understanding of fundamental data structures, algorithmic design, runtime analysis, and software development best practices.

## Course Focus
Throughout this course, I explored various data structures and algorithms and analyzed their performance in solving computational problems.  
Key learning areas include:
- Designing efficient algorithms
- Implementing core data structures (vectors, hash tables, trees)
- Performing runtime and complexity analysis
- Understanding algorithmic trade-offs and scalability

## Project Description
The main project in this repository focuses on designing and analyzing a program that:
1. Prints a list of all computer science courses in alphanumeric order.
2. Displays course titles and prerequisites for a selected course.

This project was implemented using multiple data structures to evaluate their efficiency and determine the best solution through runtime analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio / Replit / GCC (depending on environment)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Instructor Information
**Professor:** Sathish Gopalakrishnan
